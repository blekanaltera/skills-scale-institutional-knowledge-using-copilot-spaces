### Handoff Points Defined
- [ ] **Product Manager → Business Analyst**: Requirements elaboration process agreed
- [ ] **Product Manager → UX Designer**: Design review and approval process defined
- [ ] **Business Analyst → Developers**: Requirements sign-off and clarification process established
- [ ] **UX Designer → Developers**: Design handoff format and review process agreed

- [ ] **Scrum Master ↔ Project Manager**: Coordination touchpoints scheduled

## Communication Paths

### Decision Authority
- [ ] **Scope changes**: Approved by Product Manager, coordinated by Project Manager
- [ ] **Technical approach**: Decided by Tech Lead with input from Developers
- [ ] **Process improvements**: Facilitated by Scrum Master, approved by team consensus
- [ ] **Release timing**: Coordinated by Release Manager and Project Manager
- [ ] **Requirements interpretation**: Clarified by Business Analyst or Product Manager

### Escalation Paths
- [ ] **Technical blockers**: Developer → Tech Lead → Project Manager → Product Manager
- [ ] **Process impediments**: Anyone → Scrum Master → Project Manager
- [ ] **Requirements ambiguity**: Developer → Business Analyst → Product Manager
- [ ] **Design conflicts**: Developer → UX Designer → Product Manager
- [ ] **Deployment issues**: Developer/QA → Release Manager → Project Manager

## Execution Phase

### Regular Touchpoints
- [ ] **Daily Standup**: Facilitated by Scrum Master or PM, attended by delivery team
- [ ] **Backlog Refinement**: Led by Product Manager, supported by Business Analyst and team
- [ ] **Sprint Planning**: Facilitated by Scrum Master, with PM and team
- [ ] **Design Reviews**: Led by UX Designer, with Product Manager and Developers
- [ ] **Release Planning**: Coordinated by Release Manager, with PM and QA

### Quality Gates
- [ ] **Requirements Review**: Business Analyst validates with Product Manager before dev starts
- [ ] **Design Approval**: UX Designer signs off before implementation
- [ ] **Code Review**: Peer developer approval required before merge
- [ ] **QA Sign-off**: QA approves before release candidate status
- [ ] **Release Approval**: Release Manager confirms go/no-go

## Role Boundaries & Collaboration Points

### Product Manager & Business Analyst

- **SM owns**: Team facilitation, impediment removal, process coaching
- **Collaboration**: Partner on delivery planning; SM shields team, PM manages external dependencies

### UX Designer & Developers
- **UX owns**: User research, design mockups, interaction patterns, accessibility
- **Developers own**: Implementation, technical feasibility, performance
- **Collaboration**: Early design reviews for feasibility; ongoing implementation support

### Release Manager & Project Manager
- **RM owns**: Deployment execution, release schedule, deployment validation
- **PM owns**: Delivery timeline, stakeholder communication, project scope
- **Collaboration**: Align release windows with project milestones and stakeholder needs

## Post-Project

### Knowledge Transfer
- [ ] Documentation updated in repository
- [ ] Lessons learned captured in retrospective
- [ ] Handoff to support/maintenance team completed (if applicable)
- [ ] Role-specific artifacts archived or maintained:
  - [ ] Product Manager: Roadmap updates, success metrics
  - [ ] Project Manager: Final status report, risk register
  - [ ] Business Analyst: Requirements documentation, process maps
  - [ ] UX Designer: Design files, usability test results
  - [ ] Release Manager: Deployment runbooks, release notes
  - [ ] Developers: Code documentation, architecture diagrams
