# OctoAcme â€” Project Initiation Guide

## Purpose
Define the initial steps to validate and authorize work, align stakeholders, and create a lightweight plan.

## When to use
Whenever a new project idea or feature proposal is ready to be explored.

## Goals
- Confirm business need and measurable outcome
- Identify stakeholders & champions
- Define success criteria and initial timeline
- Decide go/no-go for planning

## Minimum Deliverables
- Project One-pager (Problem, Goal, Success Metrics)
- Stakeholder list & communication plan
- High-level timeline and key milestones
- Initial risk list
- Resource needs (team roles, rough effort estimate)

## Team Composition Considerations
When identifying resource needs, consider which roles are needed for the project:
- **Always Required**: Project Manager, Product Manager, Developers
- **Commonly Required**: QA/Testing, Scrum Master (for Agile projects)
- **As Needed**: 
  - UX Designer (for customer-facing features or new user experiences)
  - Release Manager (for complex or high-risk deployments)
  - Business Analyst (for requirements-heavy or process-focused projects)
  
Clarify role boundaries early:
- Who owns the backlog? (Product Manager)
- Who coordinates delivery? (Project Manager)
- Who facilitates team process? (Scrum Master, if assigned)
- Who manages deployments? (Release Manager or designated developer)
